summary: |
  This exercise will start by deploying a broken Cloud Foundry to your bosh-lite.
  After the deployment is complete you will receive further instruction.

  *** REQUIREMENTS ***
  This exercise requires the following:
    * The `bosh` Golang cli installed
    * A bosh-lite with no existing cf deployment

prompt: |
  After the most recent CF deployment I can't push apps anymore.
  It says "Error restarting application: StagingError" when I try to push.
  Any ideas?

  Use the CF CLI, `bosh ssh`, and UNIX commands to figure out what is going on.
  The cf API is `api.$BOSH_LITE_DOMAIN` and the login is admin/admin.

solution: |
  The Operator accidentally swapped out the CC Uploader
  TLS cert for the statsdinjector cert. This caused
  all droplet uploads to fail as the communication
  between CC Uploader and CC was busted.

  To check your answer, you could run:
  `openssl verify -verbose -CAfile cc-ca.pem cc-uploader.crt`
  This will tell you that CC Uploader TLS cert was not
  signed for the CC CA.

hints:
  - Try running `cf push` and look at the logs during the push. How far does the process get?
  - The `push` logs show that Diego successfully finished staging but was unable to upload the droplet. Which components are responsible for uploading the droplet?
  - The cc-uploader job uploads takes the droplet from Diego and uploads it to the api job. Does the cc-uploader job have any interesting logs?
