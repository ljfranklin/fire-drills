Howdy y'all! I'm Foundry Fred and I'm here to help teach you how to put out production fires before they happen.
I can run you through some fire drills to simulate a production issue in order to better understand the system.

## Instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/ljfranklin/fire-drills.git fire-drills
cd fire-drills
wget -O ./fire-drills https://github.com/ljfranklin/fire-drills/releases/download/v0.0.1/fire-drills_v0.0.1_osx
chmod +x ./fire-drills
./fire-drills -h
```
